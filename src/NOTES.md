_Design System Journey_

### INTRO

**Intro**

- my name is dan and I struggle with everything.
- somehow HappyCo let me at their Design System.

**Journey to the System**

- Come with us now on a Journey through time and space.
- brief overview of what we're talking about
- some of the story of how our current system came about
- approaches found useful
- some quick reflections

### DESIGN SYSTEM, WAT?

- just to clear it up - Design System? What? (Apart from it needing a differnt name)

**What do we mean by Design System**

- good question!
- imagine building blocks
- can use these basic blocks to build a city

**Why a Design System?**

- Consistent UX
- Abstract complexities of cross-browser (ie / safari), accessibility
- Same language spoken across engineering, design, product
- lower barrierâˆ« to entry for team members.
- keeping lego example, can say "I want 3 windows" - don't need to then build windows and figure out how they might work

### HISTORY/JOURNEY STORY

- back to our Design system... how did we get to where we are?

**Early History**

- (well before)
- Each App/Area defined its own custom styling, components
- For short term - is faster

**System v1**

- Some consolidation and shared components/lib
- still scoped at an individual 'App' level
- modified as usecases appeared
- due to no holistic management, quickly drifted, or became prop-party-time
- No feedback loop with design/design tools

**System v2**

- When undertaking a new product set, attempted to collate some of the earlier consolidation work into a 'System' approach
- Added storybook, began cataloging. Started aligning some Design tooling.
- Greater holistic approach, however still not designed from 'ground up' to deal with a System.
- Example of a button with prop-a-rama

**System v3**

- Started brand new feature set with new app - needed to share some core UI across multiple apps and areas.
- Greater emphasis on multiple teams, agility and speed of frontend.
- Also had an opportunity to rethink holisitic approach; composition, lower-level system primitives and composing, remove need for custom CSS.

### APPROACHES

- _??_ Need to segue from history to our approaches now....

**Influences?**

- i.e. we stole all these ideas.

**System Component API Approach**

- Most of the component API is really just React component good practice...
- Semantic Props - Make props align with terminology, especially easier for a Design-centered person to match.
- TS gives us typing, but also reduces available 'settings' for someone implementing.
- Responsive Props.

**Typography Approach**

- Text elements on all text - truncate.
- Heading element.
- Cap size, remove ascender/descenders and odd line height spacing... ZOMG

**Layout approach**

- One major change, create systemised layout components
- if familiar with flutter or other UI development - quite common
- we also support ie11 and safari, so need to be careful about how layouts work
- lol, response to component style approach https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22678348
- https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/
- Margin should be a property of the enclosing container, not the items in it.
- https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/
- Braid ( https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/) heavily influences the majority of our approaches - including layout components and responsive props.
- Styled System (https://styled-system.com/) is some of the base with which Braid is designed from, we often look at implementations within Braid and cross reference with any in Styled System to form our own approach.
- example?

**Forms Approach**

- Reach UI (https://reach.tech/) - our â€˜complexâ€™ components often use Reach UI components as a base, as they are accessible and designed to be styled/composed as needed. We also use the approach from Reach UI of internal data attribute selectors to override styles of our system components.
- use Formik for forms approach - as such provide integrated 'Field' components.
- Formik wrappers on base input components - allows quick creation of forms.

### REFLECTIONS

**Some gripes**

- Design tooling still

**Positives**

- Can implement many pages without a line of custom CSS (i.e. CSS outside of system components).
- Next step allowing rapid iteration prototyping within a tool like playroom.
- Rarely get cross-browser layout issues
