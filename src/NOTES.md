_Design System Journey_

### INTRO

**Intro**

- my name is dan and I struggle with everything.
- actually a Frontend Engineer at HappyCo working on the platform team.
- somehow HappyCo let me at their Design System.

**Journey to the System**

- Come with us now on a Journey through time and space.

- _brief overview of what we're talking about_
- some of the story of how our current system came about
- approaches found useful
- some quick reflections

### DESIGN SYSTEM, WAT?

**Design System**

- just to clear it up - Design System? What? (Apart from it needing a differnt name)

**What do we mean by Design System**

- good question!
- imagine building blocks
- can use these basic blocks to build a city

**Why a Design System?**

- Consistent UX
- Abstract complexities of cross-browser (ie / safari), accessibility
- Same language spoken across engineering, design, product
- lower barrierâˆ« to entry for team members.
- keeping lego example, can say "I want 3 windows" - don't need to then build windows and figure out how they might work

### HISTORY/JOURNEY STORY

**Journey so far**

- back to our Design system... how did we get to where we are?

**Early History**

- (well before)
- Each App/Area defined its own custom styling, components
- For short term - is faster

**System v1**

- Some consolidation and shared components/lib
- still scoped at an individual 'App' level
- modified as usecases appeared
- due to no holistic management, quickly drifted, or became prop-party-time
- No feedback loop with design/design tools

**System v2**

- When undertaking a new product set, attempted to collate some of the earlier consolidation work into a 'System' approach
- Added storybook, began cataloging. Started aligning some Design tooling.
- Greater holistic approach, however still not designed from 'ground up' to deal with a System.
- Example of a button with prop-a-rama

**System v3**

- Started brand new feature set with new app - needed to share some core UI across multiple apps and areas.
- Greater emphasis on multiple teams, agility and speed of frontend.
- Also had an opportunity to rethink holisitic approach; composition, lower-level system primitives and composing, remove need for custom CSS.

### APPROACHES

**Approaches**

- So that's how we got here, now for some actual approaches uncovered along the way.

**Influences?**

- First up some thankyou's... i.e. we stole all these ideas.
- Most of the component API is really just React component good practice...

- Braid ( https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/) heavily influences the majority of our approaches - including layout components and responsive props.
- Styled System (https://styled-system.com/) is some of the base with which Braid is designed from, we often look at implementations within Braid and cross reference with any in Styled System to form our own approach.
- Reach UI (https://reach.tech/) - our â€˜complexâ€™ components often use Reach UI components as a base, as they are accessible and designed to be styled/composed as needed. We also use the approach from Reach UI of internal data attribute selectors to override styles of our system components.

**System Component API Approach**

- Semantic Props - Make props align with terminology, especially easier for a Design-centered person to match.
- TS gives us typing, but also reduces available 'settings' for someone implementing.
- Responsive Props.

**Typography Approach**

- Text elements on all text - has handy props like 'truncate'.
- Heading element.
- Cap size, remove ascender/descenders and odd line height spacing... ZOMG

**Layout approach - Layout Components**

- One major change, create systemised layout components
- if familiar with flutter or other UI development - quite common to have component-level layout abstractions.
- we also support ie11 and safari, so need to be careful about how layouts work

**Layout approach - No Margins!@!!**

- For our layouts, we use the rule of no margins - or no surrounding whitespace.
- Margin should be a property of the enclosing container, not the items in it.
- Max Stoiber gives a great quick article on this.

**Layout approach - lol**

- lol, response to component style approach https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22678348

**Layout approach - examples**

-

**Forms Approach**

- use Formik for forms approach. Really most of the coolness here is due to Formik.
- Not used Formik before - Declarative Form Framework.
- as such provide integrated 'Field' components.
- Formik wrappers on base input components - allows quick creation of forms.
- Generically handle errors in both visuals and form functionality through Formik.

### REFLECTIONS

**Some gripes**

- Design tooling still

**Positives**

- Can implement many pages without a line of custom CSS (i.e. CSS outside of system components).
- Next step allowing rapid iteration prototyping within a tool like playroom.
- Rarely get cross-browser layout issues

### OUTRO

**Outro**

- Thanks for listening! Hope you enjoyed!
- Hit me up on the twits!
- Ill leave with you this..... Questions?
