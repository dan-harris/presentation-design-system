_Design System Journey_

**Intro**

**Journey to the System**

- brief overview of what we're talking about

**What do we mean by Design System**

**Why a Design System?**

- Consistent UX
- Abstract complexities of cross-browser (ie / safari)
- Same language spoken across engineering, design, product
- lower barrier to entry for team members.

**UI triangle??**

- Good User Experience
- Cheap Maintenance
- Fast Performance

**Early History**

- (well before)
- Each App/Area defined its own custom styling, components
- For short term - is faster

**System v1**

- Some consolidation and shared components/lib
- still scoped at an individual 'App' level
- modified as usecases appeared
- due to no holistic management, quickly drifted, or became prop-party-time
- No feedback loop with design/design tools

**System v2**

- When undertaking a new product set, attempted to collate some of the earlier consolidation work into a 'System' approach
- added storybook, began cataloging. Started aligning some Design tooling.
- greater holistic approach, however still not designed from 'ground up' to deal with a System.

**System v3**

- Started with ...

**Layout approach**

- why?

**rands**

- use reach
- forms approach? Formik?
